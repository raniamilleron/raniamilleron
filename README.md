# Welcome

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile.

I bring a background in biomedical science and infectious disease epidemiology, with growing technical fluency in computational tools used to interpret and translate genomic data into real-world insights. My work bridges scientific analysis and strategic decision-making in public health and diagnostics, supporting initiatives in Medical Affairs, Scientific Affairs, and Global Health.

## About Me
- 🌍 Strategically focused on integrating pathogen genomics and data interpretation to support regulatory, clinical, and population-level health decisions.  
- 🧪 **PhD** in Biomedical Science | **SM** in Infectious Disease Epidemiology.  
- 💬 Strong communicator skilled in translating complex data for scientific, regulatory, and cross-functional audiences.  
- 🔧 Applying **Bash**, **R**, **Nextstrain**, and **Microreact** to build foundational tools and explore real-world applications of genomics in public health and diagnostics.  

## Current Projects
- **[genomic-workflows-strategy](https://github.com/raniamilleron/genomic-workflows-strategy)** – Nextflow-based workflows for genomic data processing; demonstrates pipeline literacy and workflow communication.  
- **[data-visualization](https://github.com/raniamilleron/data-visualization)** – R and Shiny projects for visualizing genomic and public health datasets.  
- **[sequence-data-tools](https://github.com/raniamilleron/sequence-data-tools)** – Bash scripts for sequence data utilities (e.g., GC content, reverse complement).  
- **[utilities](https://github.com/raniamilleron/utilities)** – General-purpose scripts to automate bioinformatics and data-cleaning tasks.  
- **[CodeReview](https://github.com/raniamilleron/CodeReview)** – Examples and reviews of shell/R snippets and workflow components for learning and refinement.
