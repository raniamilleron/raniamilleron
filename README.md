# Welcome

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile.

I bring a background in biomedical science and infectious disease epidemiology, with growing technical fluency in computational tools used to interpret and translate genomic data into real-world insights. My work bridges scientific analysis and strategic decision-making in public health and diagnostics, supporting initiatives in Medical Affairs, Scientific Affairs, and Global Health.

## About Me
<<<<<<< HEAD
- 🌍 Strategically focused on integrating pathogen genomics and data interpretation to support regulatory, clinical, and population-level health decisions.
- 🧪 PhD in Biomedical Science | SM in Infectious Disease Epidemiology.
- 💬 Strong communicator skilled in translating complex data for scientific, regulatory, and cross-functional audiences.
- 🔧 Applying Bash, R, Nextstrain, and Microreact to build foundational tools and explore real-world applications of genomics in public health and diagnostics.

## Current Projects (More to come)
📌 Note: This GitHub portfolio is a work in progress. I’m currently documenting select projects that reflect my focus on applied genomics, scientific communication, and strategic impact in public health and medical/scientific affairs. More updates coming soon.
- **[Coming Soon] Genomic Analysis in R**: Used public datasets to design and analyze a real-world research question related to historical pathogen evolution.
- **[Coming Soon] Bash-Based Genomic Pipeline**: Built and executed a pipeline from scratch, demonstrating understanding of sequence data processing and analysis workflows.
- **Utilities**: Scripts to support data cleaning and automation in bioinformatics workflows.
- **Visualization Tools**: R and Shiny-based tools for presenting sequence and epidemiological data to support scientific communication and decision-making.
- **Sequence Data Tools**: Small utilities for analyzing sequence data, including GC content and reverse complement functions.
