# Greetings!
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am building expertise in bioinformatics by applying computational tools like Bash, R, Nextstrain, and MicroReact
to analyze genomic data and support public health initiatives. My background in epidemiology informs my approach,
particularly in pathogen genomics and data visualization.

## About Me
- ðŸ§¬ Focusing on bioinformatics, specifically in pathogen genomics, epidemiology, and data visualization.
- ðŸŽ“ PhD in Biomedical Science, SM in Infectious Disease Epidemiology.
- ðŸ’¼ Open to collaborations in bioinformatics and public health projects.
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning Bash and R for genomic analysis and data visualization.

## Current Projects
- **Utilities**: Automation scripts for bioinformatics tasks.
- **Data Visualization**: Projects visualizing genomic and public health data using R and Shiny.
- **Sequence Data Tools**: Scripts for analyzing sequence data (e.g., calculating GC content, reverse complementing DNA
